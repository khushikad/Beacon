        <h3>SCIENCE PROGRAMS</h3>
        <p>The S.T.E.M. department hosts three major events throughout the school year. The purpose of these events is
          to further peak student interest in STEM related fields. Many scientists from our community donate their time
          to mentor, judge, and/or teach our IUSD students. The 2022-2023 Science Fair is live now
